# Realization of Logic Gates Using McCulloch-Pitts Neuron Model

This Google Colab notebook, `MC_neuron.ipynb`, demonstrates the implementation of basic logic gates—AND, OR, and NOT—using the McCulloch-Pitts (MP) neuron model. The MP neuron, introduced in 1943, is a foundational concept in artificial neural networks, modeling simple binary decision-making processes.

## Overview

The McCulloch-Pitts neuron is a simplified representation of a biological neuron, operating on binary inputs and producing a binary output based on a threshold function. By appropriately setting weights and thresholds, MP neurons can simulate fundamental logic gates. This notebook illustrates how to configure MP neurons to replicate the behavior of AND, OR, and NOT gates.

## Logic Gates Implemented

1. **AND Gate**: Outputs 1 if both inputs are 1; otherwise, outputs 0.
2. **OR Gate**: Outputs 1 if at least one input is 1; otherwise, outputs 0.
3. **NOT Gate**: Outputs the inverse of the input.

## Getting Started

To explore the implementations:

1. **Open the Notebook**:
   - Access the `MC_neuron.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.

2. **Run the Cells**:
   - Execute each cell sequentially to observe the behavior of the respective logic gates.

## Usage

Each section of the notebook focuses on a specific logic gate, providing the following:

- **Explanation**: A brief overview of the logic gate's function.
- **Implementation**: Python code using the MP neuron model.
- **Output**: The truth table demonstrating the gate's behavior.
